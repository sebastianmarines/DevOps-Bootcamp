# Monitoring Commands

##Â Memmon
Memmon is a supervisor that may be subscribed to a tick event. A tick happens every _x_ seconds (60 seconds is recommended), and when memmon receives this event it checks that all the programs running under a supervisor are not exceeding a certain amount of memory.

If a process exceeds this limit, memmon will restart the process and optionally send an email.

## Htop/top
