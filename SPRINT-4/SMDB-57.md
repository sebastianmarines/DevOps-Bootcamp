# Git

## Repository

A repository tracks all the changes made to files in your project, building a history over time.

This allows you to travel your project history over time.

## Branch

Branches allow you to develop new features in a project without affecting the main version of the project.

## Clone repo

`git clone https://example.com/repository.git`

## Clone branch

`git clone -b <branchname> https://example.com/repository.git`

## Hooks

Hooks are scripts that run automatically every time a particular event occurs in a repository.

## Global vs Local config

Git will use the global configuration for all repositories, but you can specify repository specific configurations that will override the global ones inside that specific repo.

## Most used commands

- `git status`
- `git add <FILE>`
- `git commit -m <COMMIT MESSAGE>`
- `git init`
- `git diff`
- `git pull`
- `git push`
- `git fetch`
- `git checkout`
