# Intro to DevOps

## DevOps

DevOps is a set of practices to build, test, and deploy your code in small and frequent steps.

It ensures speed, rapid delivery, reliability, scale, and security.

## 12 Factor

1. **Codebase**: One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys.
2. **Dependencies**: Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies.
3. **Config**: Store config in the environment.
4. **Backing Services**: Treat backing services as attached resources.
5. **Build, release, run**: Strictly separate build and run stages.
6. **Processes**: Execute the app as one or more stateless processes.
7. **Port binding**: Export services via port binding.
8. **Concurrency**: Scale out via the process model.
9. **Disposability**: Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown.
10. **Dev/prod parity**: Keep, development, staging, and production as similar as possible.
11. **Logs**: Treat logs as event streams.
12. **Admin processes**: Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes.
